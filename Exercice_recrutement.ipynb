        "Ar first, you might want to take a look at the [official documentation](https://doc.crowdsec.net/docs/intro) of the CrowdSec software. This will remind you of the context of how the data are collected, as well as the purpose of the software. \n",

        "We favor the explanations and the details of your approach over the performance of the model picked up. The quality of the code is not a priority, but you should do your best to stick to Python conventions and keep the code clear. You may use *any* library you want, just list them in a `requirements.txt` file attached. The results of the home assignment should be in the form of a Jupyter notebook - don't be afraid of using Markdown cells to explain your approach. \n",
